# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a sophisticated multi-agent financial trading system that automates market analysis and trade execution. The system combines MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for standardized data access with a multi-agent system using Google's A2A protocol for inter-agent communication. The system will perform fundamental and technical analysis, manage risk, and execute simulated trades in a paper trading environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to initiate automated trading strategies through a simple API call, so that I can leverage multi-agent analysis without manual coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/start_strategy` with a trading goal THEN the PortfolioManagerAgent SHALL receive and parse the investment strategy
2. WHEN the strategy is received THEN the system SHALL decompose it into analytical tasks for delegation
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL log the final outcome with trade confirmation details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want MCP servers to provide standardized access to financial data, so that agents can access market information through a consistent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent requests stock price data THEN the MarketDataMCP SHALL return simulated historical price data in a structured format
2. WHEN an agent requests market news THEN the MarketDataMCP SHALL return a list of simulated news headlines and summaries
3. WHEN an agent requests financial statements THEN the MarketDataMCP SHALL return simplified, simulated financial statement data
4. WHEN an agent requests technical indicator calculations THEN the TechnicalAnalysisMCP SHALL calculate and return the requested indicator values
5. WHEN an agent requests trade execution THEN the TradingExecutionMCP SHALL simulate the trade and return confirmation details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want agents to communicate using the A2A protocol, so that the system can coordinate complex multi-step analysis workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PortfolioManagerAgent needs fundamental analysis THEN it SHALL send an A2A request to the FundamentalAnalystAgent
2. WHEN the PortfolioManagerAgent needs technical analysis THEN it SHALL send an A2A request to the TechnicalAnalystAgent
3. WHEN a trade proposal is ready THEN the PortfolioManagerAgent SHALL send an A2A request to the RiskManagerAgent for approval
4. WHEN a trade is approved THEN the PortfolioManagerAgent SHALL send an A2A request to the TradeExecutorAgent
5. WHEN agents communicate THEN they SHALL use JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP via `/a2a` endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fundamental analyst, I want an agent that evaluates company financial health, so that trading decisions are based on solid fundamental analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FundamentalAnalystAgent receives a research task THEN it SHALL query the MarketDataMCP for financial statements and news
2. WHEN analyzing company data THEN the agent SHALL determine fundamental strength based on financial metrics
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL return a ranked list of suitable companies with analysis summaries
4. WHEN evaluating tech stocks THEN the agent SHALL consider revenue growth, profitability, and recent news sentiment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want an agent that analyzes price action and market timing, so that trades are executed at optimal entry points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TechnicalAnalystAgent receives a stock ticker THEN it SHALL fetch historical price data from MarketDataMCP
2. WHEN analyzing price data THEN the agent SHALL calculate relevant technical indicators using TechnicalAnalysisMCP
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL return a clear signal ('BUY', 'SELL', or 'HOLD') with confidence score
4. WHEN generating buy signals THEN the agent SHALL consider moving averages, RSI, and other technical indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want an agent that evaluates trade proposals against risk parameters, so that the portfolio maintains appropriate risk levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RiskManagerAgent receives a trade proposal THEN it SHALL check current portfolio status via TradingExecutionMCP
2. WHEN evaluating trades THEN the agent SHALL apply pre-defined risk rules for position sizing and diversification
3. WHEN risk evaluation is complete THEN the agent SHALL return 'APPROVE' or 'DENY' decision with reasoning
4. WHEN portfolio limits are exceeded THEN the agent SHALL deny the trade proposal

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trade executor, I want an agent that handles trade execution, so that approved trades are properly executed and confirmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TradeExecutorAgent receives an approved trade order THEN it SHALL call the execute_mock_trade function on TradingExecutionMCP
2. WHEN executing trades THEN the agent SHALL handle both buy and sell orders with specified quantities
3. WHEN trade execution completes THEN the agent SHALL confirm the trade and report results back to PortfolioManagerAgent
4. WHEN trades fail THEN the agent SHALL report error details and suggested remediation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all services to run as separate FastAPI applications, so that the system is modular and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN each MCP server SHALL run as a separate FastAPI application on different ports
2. WHEN the system starts THEN each agent SHALL run as a separate FastAPI application with unique endpoints
3. WHEN services are running THEN they SHALL provide automatic API documentation via FastAPI
4. WHEN the main script runs THEN it SHALL orchestrate starting all services and initiate the workflow

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can monitor system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent processes a request THEN it SHALL log the request details and processing steps
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL log all A2A protocol exchanges
3. WHEN errors occur THEN agents SHALL log error details and continue processing where possible
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a complete audit trail of all decisions and actions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain portfolio state, so that risk management and position tracking work correctly across multiple trades.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the TradingExecutionMCP SHALL update the in-memory portfolio state
2. WHEN portfolio status is requested THEN the system SHALL return current positions, cash balance, and portfolio value
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN portfolio state SHALL be reset to initial simulation values
4. WHEN multiple trades occur THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate position and cash tracking
